# sparcd-tagger — implementation plan

A static, browser-based tagging interface for SPARC'd camera-trap images.
Tags persist locally in IndexedDB and sync to S3-compatible storage as
canonical Camtrap-DP metadata updates under each upload prefix.

Sits alongside SPARC'd; reads the same MinIO/R2/S3 buckets the upstream
readers use, and produces the same row/column `observations.csv` shape (the
verified v016 20-column layout — see Camtrap-DP encoding). It is a
replacement/add-on for the taggers in
[`sparcd-web`](https://github.com/culverlab/sparcd-web) and the
[`sparcd`](https://github.com/culverlab/sparcd) Java app. Compatibility is
the primary contract: a user can tag an image in this tool, open and re-tag
that same image in the Java app, then preview/query it in `sparcd-web` or the
static marimo notebook. Therefore S3 sync updates the canonical upload-level
`media.csv`, `observations.csv`, and `UploadMeta.json` that those tools already
read. Versioned append-only copies are allowed for audit/recovery, but they are
not the compatibility output.

> **How the upstream reader actually surfaces species (verified by the
> uploader's P3, `../sparcd-uploader/plan.md` "CRITICAL verification
> finding").** The existing reader is **Python, not Java**
> (`server/s3/s3_access_helpers.py: get_s3_images`). It **lists image objects
> under the upload prefix, presigns the listed key, then decorates those images
> from canonical upload-level `media.csv` and `observations.csv`, matched on
> the full object key.** It does not read
> `<uploadPrefix>/observations/<userId>/<ISO>.csv`. The Java app likewise
> reads and rewrites canonical `deployments.csv`, `media.csv`,
> `observations.csv`, and `UploadMeta.json`. So append-only sidecars alone are
> invisible to the existing tools; canonical merge/replacement is required.

## Changelog

- **2026-06-03** — Reconciled against the shipped sparcd-uploader (P0–P6)
  and its fix commits. Build-time bucket allowlist replaced by runtime
  BYO-S3 discovery; `@sparcd/s3-safe` description updated to the shipped
  API; the old Java/Next web-reader assumption corrected to the Python
  list-under-prefix + canonical CSV decoration reader; `observations.csv`
  encoding pinned to the already-shipped `@sparcd/camtrap` writer;
  settings-bucket discovery, `connectionId` cache keying, and CORS error
  translation folded in from the uploader build.
- **2026-06-04** — Tightened the tagger goal around Java-app-compatible
  canonical metadata updates. P0 now starts with shared Vitest contract tests
  and golden fixtures for uploader + tagger data handling before any S3 write
  path is built.
- **2026-06-04** — Rechecked the Java app save path. Sync now treats
  `media.csv`, `observations.csv`, and `UploadMeta.json` as the canonical
  replacement unit; timestamp corrections update media timestamp col 4;
  `imagesWithSpecies` follows Java's running delta; `editComments` are
  mandatory; and Java's unconditional overwrites are documented honestly.

## Goal

A keyboard-driven tagging UI that a researcher can open in a browser, tag
several hundred images in a session, save progress locally without thinking
about it, and sync to S3 when ready — while preserving the canonical metadata
contract used by the Java app, `sparcd-web`, and the marimo/static explorer.

## Static BYO-S3 security contract

Same contract the uploader settled on (`../sparcd-uploader/plan.md`). This
tagger is a **static browser app**: no backend service, no trusted server
session, no server-side environment variables at runtime. A security review
must treat the bundle as untrusted client code.

**Decision.** Users bring their own S3-compatible endpoint, credentials,
settings bucket, and collection bucket. Official SPARC'd deployments use the
same model: credentials are scoped by IAM/provider policy and CORS, not by
bucket names compiled into the app.

**Enforceable controls.**

- **IAM / provider policy** limits which buckets, prefixes, and S3 actions
  the supplied credentials can use.
- **Bucket CORS** limits which hosted app origins can make browser S3 calls.
- **`@sparcd/s3-safe`** is the only S3 client boundary. It exposes read
  methods, immutable append-only writers, and one reviewed conditional
  replacement method for canonical Camtrap metadata. No delete or copy API.
- **Sync protocol controls**: dry-run-by-default, `HEAD`/ETag verification,
  pre-write conflict detection, immutable pre-write snapshots, and
  conditional canonical replacement.

**Non-controls.**

- Build-time `VITE_*` bucket allowlists are **not** used for authorization —
  they are not enforceable in a static app and would break BYO-S3 users.
- Client-side bucket discovery is **not** authorization. It only finds
  buckets the supplied credentials and CORS policy already expose.

## Stack

- **Vite + React 18 + TypeScript** — single-page app, fast dev, static bundle
- **Tailwind + Field Notebook bespoke components** — match the uploader build;
  do not introduce shadcn/ui unless the shared design system changes first
- **TanStack Query** — S3 fetch cache and request dedup. **Key every query on
  a `connectionId`**, not on endpoint+access-key alone, and call a
  `clearClientCache()` on connect/disconnect — the uploader shipped this fix
  (`8daf58f`) after stale credentials were reused across reconnects.
- **TanStack Virtual** — virtualized image lists for large uploads
- **Zustand** — edit/UI state
- **Dexie.js** — IndexedDB wrapper, draft persistence
- **react-hotkeys-hook** — keyboard shortcuts
- **react-zoom-pan-pinch** — full-size image inspection
- **`@sparcd/s3-safe` only for S3** — app code never imports
  `@aws-sdk/client-s3`; presigned image URLs come from
  `SafeS3Client.presignedGet`
- **Vitest** — shared contract tests for Camtrap CSV, upload metadata,
  uploader fixtures, tagger merge output, and wrapper safety behavior
- **`@sparcd/camtrap` CSV parser/writer** — extend the shipped writer with the
  readers/merge helpers needed here; use PapaParse internally only if the
  package needs a CSV engine
- **fuse.js** — fuzzy search for species autocomplete

## Shared packages

Lives under `packages/` in this monorepo. Internal-only; no `dist/`,
consumers bundle the source via Vite + pnpm workspace resolution.

### `packages/s3-safe` → `@sparcd/s3-safe`

Already shipped (the uploader established it, P0–P6), but the tagger needs
one reviewed extension because Java-app-compatible tagging must replace
canonical metadata. The single, blessed S3 boundary; every tool that touches
storage imports it. The tagger uses the read methods, `writeImmutable` for
audit snapshots, and a new conditional replacement method for canonical
`media.csv` / `observations.csv` / `UploadMeta.json`. It does **not** need
`writeImmutableStream` (that is the uploader's per-file multipart writer; the
tagger never streams large blobs). Shipped surface plus required extension:

1. **Bucket allowlists, not a security boundary in a static app.** The
   constructor is `(cfg, readAllowlist, writeAllowlist = [])` — a separate,
   opt-in **write allowlist that is empty by default** (`BucketNotWritableError`
   is the hard stop). In a BYO-S3 static app the tagger passes broad runtime
   scope (`*`) for both, exactly as the uploader does; IAM/policy + CORS are
   the real gate (see Static BYO-S3 security contract). The allowlist scopes
   *object* operations only.
2. **Read methods**, plus the tagger write surface:
   - `listObjects(bucket, prefix)` → `AsyncIterable<ObjectInfo>`
   - `getObject(bucket, key)` → `Uint8Array`
   - `statObject(bucket, key)` → metadata only
   - `presignedGet(bucket, key, ttlSec)` → URL
   - `listBuckets()` → bucket names; **intentionally not allowlist-gated**
     (it reads no object data) — the discovery primitive the tagger uses to
     find the settings and collection buckets at runtime
   - `writeImmutable(bucket, key, body)` → conditional `PutObject` with
     `IfNoneMatch: "*"`, throwing `PreconditionFailedError` (412) if `key`
     already exists, or `ConditionalPutUnsupportedError` (501) if the backend
     does not enforce the precondition (no silent HEAD-then-PUT fallback)
   - `replaceIfUnchanged(bucket, key, body, { etag, contentType })` →
     conditional `PutObject` with `IfMatch: <etag>` for canonical metadata
     replacement. This is a narrow compatibility exception for
     `media.csv`, `observations.csv`, and `UploadMeta.json`, not a general
     overwrite API.
     It throws a typed conflict if the remote object changed after the draft
     was loaded.
3. **No destructive APIs exposed** — no `delete*` or `copy*`. Direct
   `@aws-sdk/client-s3` imports are forbidden outside `packages/s3-safe/src/`
   by a lint rule added before app code writes to S3.

**`IfNoneMatch: "*"` backend support.** Conditional writes require:
AWS S3 added conditional `PutObject` support in August 2024, then added
bucket-policy enforcement for conditional writes in November 2024. MinIO
and Cloudflare R2 also support conditional PUTs, but the `@sparcd/s3-safe`
README must record the exact backend versions tested for this project.
If the backend responds with `501 NotImplemented` (or returns a 200
success without enforcing the precondition), `writeImmutable` must throw a
distinct `ConditionalPutUnsupported` error and the wrapper must **not**
silently fall back to a `HEAD`-then-`PUT` path — that fallback has a
TOCTOU race the wrapper cannot close, and silently accepting it would
defeat the safety design.

**`IfMatch` backend support.** Canonical compatibility sync additionally
requires conditional replacement with `IfMatch` against the reviewed ETag for
`media.csv`, `observations.csv`, and `UploadMeta.json`. P0/P4 tests must prove
the wrapper sends the header, treats stale ETags as typed conflicts, and does
not fall back to an unconditional PUT. Live browser CORS must expose enough
`HEAD` metadata for this check to work on the target endpoint.

This is stricter than the Java desktop app, which writes with unconditional
`PutObject` and performs no ETag/concurrency check. Tagger `IfMatch` protects
tagger-vs-tagger and tagger-vs-uploader/static-tool writes; it cannot prevent a
concurrent or later Java save from overwriting canonical tagger output.

Endpoint config is the same shape for all three backends:

```ts
type S3Config = {
  endpoint: string;        // host[:port] or https://host
  region: string;          // "us-east-1" | "auto" | etc.
  accessKey: string;
  secretKey: string;
  forcePathStyle: boolean; // true for MinIO; false for AWS/R2
  secure?: boolean;        // when no scheme on endpoint
};
```

Helpers detect the backend from the endpoint and fill defaults:
- `*.r2.cloudflarestorage.com` → `region: "auto"`, `forcePathStyle: false`
- `*.amazonaws.com` → `region: <from URL>`, `forcePathStyle: false`
- anything else → MinIO defaults (`region: "us-east-1"`, `forcePathStyle: true`)

Browser-direct S3 is a hard requirement for this app. P0 must verify the
target endpoint's CORS policy allows the static app origin to call
`ListBucket`, `GetObject`, `HeadObject`, and eventually `PutObject`, and
that signed or presigned image URLs render in `<img>` without canvas access
requirements.

### `packages/camtrap` → `@sparcd/camtrap`

Pure TypeScript. No React, no S3. **Already shipped** (uploader P3); the
writer the tagger needs exists — the uploader builds against it but always
emits an empty `observations.csv`, leaving the row serializer for the tagger.
The tagger extends this package with readers, merge helpers, and shared
fixtures so uploader and tagger tests prove the same data contract.

- Types: `Deployment`, `Media`, `Observation`, plus a `CamtrapBundle` that
  groups all three for one upload. `Observation` already carries `timestamp`,
  `scientificName`, `count`, and `tags`.
- Reader: **to be added in P0**. Takes raw CSV strings (`deployments.csv`,
  `media.csv`, `observations.csv`) → parsed objects, with the fixed v016
  column-index mapping (no header row) handled in one place. It must
  round-trip rows from Java and `sparcd-web` fixtures and preserve unrelated
  rows when the tagger changes one image.
- Writer: `serializeObservations` is already verified byte-exact to the
  v016 **20-column** shape (QUOTE_ALL, LF-terminated). **Column semantics are
  pinned in code, not "to be confirmed at build time":**
  - col 4 `timestamp` — the corrected ISO timestamp
  - col 8 `scientific_name` + col 9 `count` — the SPARC'd observation
    (species + count only; there is no behaviour field)
  - **col 19 `comments`** — where the bracketed tag markers live (see grammar
    below). There is **no dedicated `tags` column**; everything bracketed
    lands in `comments`.
- Merge helpers: **to be added in P0/P1**. Given canonical media +
  observations and local draft edits, replace the media row and all observation
  rows for the edited media IDs, preserve unrelated rows, filter zero-count
  rows the same way `sparcd-web` does, update media timestamp col 4 when time
  corrections are synced, and update `UploadMeta.json` with Java-compatible
  `imagesWithSpecies` delta semantics.
- Validators: schema checks, lat/lng sanity (the swapped-column bug we hit
  in the marimo notebook), row-count checks, and tag-string parser for the
  `[COMMONNAME:Owl]` format.
- Tag marker grammar: the col-19 `comments` field holds a concatenated list
  of bracketed markers `[PREFIX:value]`. Reserved prefixes for v0 are
  `COMMONNAME` and `REQUESTED_SPECIES`. The parser must preserve and tolerate
  unknown prefixes so future tools can add markers without breaking old
  readers.

### `packages/types` → `@sparcd/types`

Minimal TS types that span more than one package:
- `Collection { bucket, uuid, name, organization }`
- `Species { genus, species, commonName, scientificName }` (plus the tree
  form used by `Settings/species.json`)
- `UserSession { userId, displayName }` for stamping immutable writes

### `packages/auth-ui` → `@sparcd/auth-ui` *(shared from day one)*

One credentials/connection screen, shared by every JS tool (tagger,
uploader, future tools). Two known consumers exist by design, so this is
shared from the start rather than duplicated. The component is
parameterized only by the tool name shown in the chrome ("SPARC'd ·
Tagger" / "· Uploader"). The form is **three fields — endpoint, access
key, secret key** — with secure/region/path-style inferred from the
endpoint (rare overrides behind an "Advanced" disclosure). It produces the
`S3Config` consumed by `@sparcd/s3-safe` and is identical everywhere.
Depends on `@sparcd/types` for the config shape.

## Compatibility test standard

Before implementing tagger S3 writes, add a shared Vitest contract harness that
both `sparcd-uploader` and `sparcd-tagger` consume. This is step 1 because the
data contract is more important than UI polish or storage plumbing.

### Shared fixture layout

Create durable golden fixtures under a shared test-data location, not inside
one app:

- `packages/camtrap/test/fixtures/java-v016/` — canonical `deployments.csv`,
  `media.csv`, `observations.csv`, `UploadMeta.json`, and `species.json`
  shaped like the Java app writes them.
- `packages/camtrap/test/fixtures/sparcd-web-v016/` — the same files shaped
  like current `sparcd-web` Python helpers write/read them. `sparcd-web` is
  newer and may be inconsistent, so Java fixtures are the compatibility
  baseline when behavior differs.
- `packages/camtrap/test/fixtures/uploader-empty-v016/` — a new uploader
  bundle with empty canonical `observations.csv`, matching
  `sparcd-uploader`.
- `packages/camtrap/test/fixtures/tagger-edited-v016/` — expected canonical
  output after common tagger operations: add species, retag species, detag an
  image, multi-species rows, Ghost (`Casper`), timestamp correction in
  `media.csv` col 4 and observation col 4, Java-compatible
  `UploadMeta.json.imagesWithSpecies` delta, mandatory `editComments`, and
  requested-species marker in comments.

Fixtures should be small enough for fast tests but large enough to cover
multiple images, nested paths, multiple deployments when relevant, and one
unrelated row that must survive every merge unchanged.

### Required Vitest coverage

- **Round-trip shape.** Parse fixture CSVs and serialize them without changing
  fixed column counts, row order, quoting policy, or unrelated rows.
- **Uploader contract.** `sparcd-uploader` output parses as valid v016
  Camtrap data and exposes an empty canonical `observations.csv` base for the
  tagger.
- **Tagger merge contract.** Applying draft edits to canonical observations
  and media produces exactly the `tagger-edited-v016` golden output.
- **Retro-compatibility contract.** The edited golden output can be read by
  lightweight Java-compatible and `sparcd-web`-compatible parsers in tests:
  species lives in observation col 8, count in col 9, common name in col 19
  as `[COMMONNAME:<name>]`, and media IDs match the full object keys used by
  `media.csv`.
- **Timestamp display contract.** Corrected capture time is written to
  `media.csv` col 4 because Java and `sparcd-web` decorate displayed image
  timestamps from media rows. Observation col 4 is also updated for edited
  observation rows, but it is not enough by itself.
- **UploadMeta contract.** `imagesWithSpecies` follows the Java save delta:
  `prior - detaggedCount + retaggedCount`, where detagged means "was tagged,
  now species-present is empty" and retagged means "was untagged, now
  species-present is non-empty." This deliberately matches Java's maintained
  tally, even if a stored `UploadMeta.json` has drifted from a clean recompute.
  Tests include a drifted-value fixture so the choice is explicit. A future
  admin repair flow may recompute and reconcile drift, but normal tagger sync
  does not.
- **Edit comment contract.** Every successful canonical sync appends an
  `UploadMeta.json.editComments` entry in the Java style:
  `Edited by <user> on <timestamp>`, where `<timestamp>` uses Java's
  `uuuu.MM.dd.HH.mm.ss` format.
- **No accidental data loss.** Retag/detag tests prove the merge only replaces
  rows for edited media IDs and never drops unrelated observations,
  deployments, or media rows.
- **Wrapper safety.** Unit tests cover the future `replaceIfUnchanged`
  behavior with mocked S3 responses: success on matching ETag, conflict on
  stale ETag, no fallback overwrite, no delete/copy command.

Root scripts should include `pnpm test` / `turbo run test`, and each package
or app with data-contract code should expose a `test` script. S3 integration
tests stay separate and opt-in; the default Vitest suite must run offline.

### Layout

Three-pane CSS grid:

- **Overview** — the primary working surface, with two view modes
  (file-explorer style) switched by a segmented control: **grid** of
  thumbnail cards, and a denser **list** whose rows each carry a tiny
  thumbnail + metadata. Both group by burst/sequence (visual bands) and
  share one selection model: single, range (Shift), additive (Cmd/Ctrl),
  whole-burst. This is where most of an upload gets cleared — bulk-tagging
  a selection in one action.
- **Focus** — `ImageViewer`, the single-image detail view drilled into
  from a thumbnail: pan/zoom, image adjustments for hard night frames,
  prev/next, timestamp + deployment overlay. For careful IDs, not bulk.
- **Right** — `TagPanel`. Species selector + count. (A SPARC'd observation
  is species + count only — there is no behavior field; see the data note
  below.) Submit applies to **all selected images at once**.
- **Top bar** — collection picker, sync status (`local-only` /
  `unsynced edits` / `synced @ <time>` / `conflict`), keyboard cheatsheet
  button. **Collection discovery reuses the uploader's runtime model**
  (`b7b161b`) as actually shipped: list visible buckets, keep
  `sparcd-<uuid>` candidates, read
  `Collections/<uuid>/collection.json`, and key selection as `bucket::uuid`.
  If we later make collection discovery bucket-name-agnostic, update uploader
  and tagger together; do not let the tagger invent a divergent collection
  model.

### Performance & interaction (implementer concern, not the design pass)

Snappiness and keyboard latency are first-class requirements — the tool
lives or dies on them. Not a Claude Design concern; these are build
decisions:

- **Virtualized thumbnail grid** (TanStack Virtual) — only mount visible
  cells; a 5,000-image upload must scroll at 60fps.
- **Thumbnail strategy** — request small presigned-URL thumbnails, lazy +
  progressive load, `loading="lazy"` / `IntersectionObserver`, decode off
  the main thread (`createImageBitmap`), and an LRU cache so revisiting a
  burst is instant. Camera-trap originals are 1–5MB; never load originals
  into the grid.
- **Keybindings** — global handler with no per-render re-binding; actions
  dispatch synchronously and update local (Zustand) state optimistically,
  so `J`/`K`/species keys never wait on I/O. Dexie writes are debounced and
  off the hot path.
- **Selection at scale** — selection state is index ranges, not per-cell
  React state, so selecting a 2,000-image burst doesn't re-render 2,000
  components.
- **CORS error translation** — reuse the uploader's P2 mapping: 404 → "not
  found", 403 → "access denied", and a status-less browser fetch failure →
  "endpoint unreachable or the bucket CORS policy needs to allow GET/HEAD
  from this origin." The SDK read works server-side; a **live in-browser CORS
  preflight against the endpoint is still unconfirmed** and this origin may
  need adding to the bucket CORS policy.

### Login screen

**Three fields only: endpoint, access key, secret key** (the marimo Python
explorer's pattern). Everything else is *inferred*, not asked:

- **Secure (HTTPS)** from the endpoint scheme (`https://` → secure; default
  secure when no scheme).
- **Region + path-style** auto-detected from the endpoint host by
  `@sparcd/s3-safe` (R2 / AWS / MinIO — see the detection rules above). No
  preset dropdown, region field, or path-style toggle on the main screen.
- Rare manual region / path-style overrides live behind a collapsed
  **"Advanced"** disclosure, hidden by default.
- Per-tool **identity** and **dry-run default** live in **Settings**, not
  the login gate.

Values prefill from `.env` during local development only. In deployable
static builds, `import.meta.env` may prefill non-secret convenience values
such as endpoint, region, and path defaults, but must never embed real access
keys or secret keys, and **never a bucket allowlist as an authorization
boundary** (buckets are discovered at runtime — see the security contract).
Users enter S3 credentials at runtime. The Java and sparcd-web apps use a
different model (server-issued token); we don't share UI with them by design
— different auth shape.

### Persistence — local

- **Dexie schema** v1:
  - `drafts` table:
    `{ id (bucket+uploadPrefix+mediaPath), bucket, uploadPrefix, mediaPath,
    baseMediaETag, baseMediaHash, baseObservationsETag,
    baseObservationsHash, baseUploadMetaETag, baseUploadMetaHash,
    auditSnapshotKey, label, count, freeTags, requestedSpecies, questionable,
    timeOverride, lastEdited, dirty }`
    (`timeOverride` = optional corrected timestamp for this one image, on
    top of the upload offset; null when unset.)
    `label` holds the applied species **or** a non-animal label like
    **Ghost** — Ghost is just another label, not a separate `blank` flag. A
    SPARC'd observation is **species + count only** — there is no `behavior`
    field. The value/encoding (how Ghost and species land in
    `observations.csv`) is **already pinned** by the shipped
    `serializeObservations`: species → col 8 `scientific_name` + col 9
    `count`; bracketed markers → col 19 `comments`. Ghost is encoded as a
    label through the same path, not a separate flag.
  - `uploads` table:
    `{ id (bucket+uploadPrefix), bucket, uploadPrefix, loadedAt,
    mediaETag, mediaHash, observationsETag, observationsHash, uploadMetaETag,
    uploadMetaHash, timeOffset }`
    (`timeOffset` = signed Δ y/mo/d/h/m/s applied to every image in the
    upload; null when unset.)
  - `sessions` table:
    `{ sessionId, userId, startedAt, finishedAt, syncedAt, syncedKey,
    syncedCsvHash }`
- **Grounding rule.** The uploader **always writes an empty canonical
  `observations.csv`** on initial upload (its open question resolved), so a
  stable base file is guaranteed — no absent-file case to handle. Every draft
  is grounded on the canonical upload-level `media.csv`, `observations.csv`,
  and `UploadMeta.json` loaded at session start. Sync-time conflict detection
  compares current remote ETag/hash values for all three files against the
  stored base values; mismatch triggers the conflict view before any canonical
  write.
- **`requestedSpecies` field.** When a tagger needs a species not in
  `Settings/species.json`, the combobox lets them tag with a free-text
  `requestedSpecies` string plus the existing `freeTags`. The sync export
  records the request as a `[REQUESTED_SPECIES:<value>]` marker in the col-19
  `comments` field (alongside `[COMMONNAME:…]`), so the output keeps the
  verified `observations.csv` row/column shape while still giving downstream
  admins a machine-readable request. This is the committed answer to open
  question #3.
- **Schema versioning.** Future schema changes use Dexie's versioning API
  (`db.version(N).stores({...}).upgrade(...)`). No ad-hoc store mutations
  outside that ladder; every bump ships with an `upgrade` callback that
  carries v(N-1) drafts forward, never destructively.
- Auto-save on every keystroke (debounced 200 ms). Recovery on next open
  surfaces any `dirty` drafts.
- Per-upload "Discard local changes" button — affects only that upload.

### Persistence — S3 sync

- "Sync" button is the only path that writes to S3.
- Pre-write:
  - `HEAD` + load canonical `<uploadPrefix>/media.csv`,
    `<uploadPrefix>/observations.csv`, and `<uploadPrefix>/UploadMeta.json`.
  - If any ETag/hash differs from the draft base, enter the conflict view:
    reload remote, show local-vs-remote media/observation/meta diffs, and
    require the user to merge or discard local edits before retrying.
  - Diff local drafts against canonical media and observations. Show a
    confirmation dialog: timestamp corrections, N additions, M modifications,
    D removals. A removal means "remove this species row from this media item"
    and is required for re-tagging compatibility; it is not an object delete.
  - Write immutable audit snapshots of the pre-change canonical files under
    `<uploadPrefix>/.sparcd-tagger-snapshots/<userId>/<ISO>/` using
    `writeImmutable`. These snapshots are for recovery only.
- Write:
  - `replaceIfUnchanged(bucket, "<uploadPrefix>/media.csv", serialized, { etag: baseMediaETag })`
  - `replaceIfUnchanged(bucket, "<uploadPrefix>/observations.csv", serialized, { etag: baseObservationsETag })`
  - `replaceIfUnchanged(bucket, "<uploadPrefix>/UploadMeta.json", serialized, { etag: baseUploadMetaETag })`
  - `UploadMeta.json.imagesWithSpecies` follows Java's running delta:
    `prior - detaggedCount + retaggedCount`. Detagged/retagged are computed
    from the same before/after species-present state used for the edited
    media rows, not from a full-bundle recompute.
  - `UploadMeta.json.editComments` is appended on every successful sync with
    the Java-style `Edited by <user> on <timestamp>` entry, using
    `uuuu.MM.dd.HH.mm.ss` for the timestamp.
  - S3 has no atomic three-object transaction. The write order is `media.csv`
    first, `observations.csv` second, `UploadMeta.json` third: if the final
    metadata write fails, existing tools can still read the new timestamp/tags,
    but the upload tile count or edit comment may be stale until the tagger
    retries. If the observations write fails after `media.csv`, readers may
    show corrected capture time before species changes. The recovery view must
    detect and repair either partial-sync state.
  - On a conditional conflict, do not retry blind. Reload, show conflict UI,
    and require an explicit merge.
  - Records `syncedAt`, new ETags, and hashes in Dexie.
- Recovery view: lists local snapshots and remote
  `.sparcd-tagger-snapshots/<userId>/<ISO>/` versions, lets the user inspect
  or restore one by running the same conditional canonical replacement flow.

The canonical files are no longer read-only in this tool. Updating them is the
point of S3 sync because current Java, `sparcd-web`, and marimo/static preview
tools read those files and ignore append-only sidecars.

## Safety design

The "absolutely no accidental writes" bar from your earlier ask is
load-bearing. Four layers, each redundant:

1. **IAM policy** — separate access key whose policy permits only
   `s3:ListBucket`, `s3:GetObject`, and `s3:PutObject` on
   `arn:aws:s3:::sparcd-test-*` (or the explicit test-bucket ARN list), with
   writes scoped to canonical compatibility files and audit snapshots:
   `Collections/*/Uploads/*/media.csv`,
   `Collections/*/Uploads/*/observations.csv`,
   `Collections/*/Uploads/*/UploadMeta.json`, and
   `Collections/*/Uploads/*/.sparcd-tagger-snapshots/*` where the backend
   supports object-prefix conditions.
   **No `s3:DeleteObject`.** Belt + suspenders below in case the policy
   is ever misconfigured.
2. **`@sparcd/s3-safe` wrapper** — the only S3 client allowed in app code.
   No destructive methods exposed. Lint rule blocks direct
   `@aws-sdk/client-s3` imports anywhere except `packages/s3-safe/src/`.
3. **Runtime permissions, not build-time bucket gates** — this is a static
   BYO-S3 app, so bucket names are never compiled into the bundle as a
   security boundary (the uploader tried a build-time allowlist +
   `ProductionGate`, then removed both). The connected credentials' IAM
   policy and bucket CORS decide what the browser can read or write. The app
   discovers the settings/collection buckets by probing for marker objects,
   keeps dry-run on by default, and uses only the reviewed wrapper APIs.
4. **Conditional canonical replacement** — every sync snapshots the old
   canonical files immutably, then replaces only `media.csv`,
   `observations.csv`, and `UploadMeta.json` with `IfMatch` against the ETags
   the user reviewed. A stale ETag is a conflict, never an automatic overwrite.

Plus a **dry-run toggle** on the sync action, on by default for the first
session. Until the user explicitly turns dry-run off, sync logs what it
would do and writes nothing.

## Time correction

Camera clocks drift / are misconfigured (DST, timezone), and corrected
timestamps drive downstream activity analysis. Two levels, mirroring the
SPARC'd Java app's `TimeShiftController` (signed offsets in
year/month/day/hour/minute/second with a live preview) and per-image
`setDateTaken`:

- **Upload-level offset** — a signed Δ (y/mo/d/h/m/s) applied to every image
  in the upload. Set from the Tag workspace / upload-scoped Settings, with a
  live "original → corrected" preview and a persistent active-offset
  indicator.
- **Per-image override** — edit one image's timestamp in the Focus view, on
  top of the upload offset.

**Non-destructive.** Originals (EXIF / canonical CSV timestamps) are never
rewritten locally outside the reviewed sync path. Corrections are stored locally
(`uploads.timeOffset`, `drafts.timeOverride`), applied on display, and emitted
as the corrected timestamp in the canonical synced output. The corrected
display/capture timestamp must be written to `media.csv` col 4
(`Media.timestamp`), because Java and `sparcd-web` decorate image capture time
from media rows. Edited observation rows also carry the corrected timestamp in
`observations.csv` col 4 (`Observation.timestamp`), per the shipped
`serializeObservations`, but writing observations alone is not sufficient.

## Sequence/burst grouping

Default heuristic: same deployment + image timestamps within `60s` of each
other → same burst. Threshold configurable per-session (slider, 5s–600s).

Bursts render as visual bands in `ImageList`. The "Apply to whole burst"
button is one keystroke.

## Species / label autocomplete

- Load `Settings/species.json` once at session start. **It almost certainly
  lives in the settings bucket, not the per-collection bucket** — the
  uploader's P2 found `Settings/locations.json` in a separate settings bucket
  (prefer `sparcd-settings-*`, fall back to legacy `sparcd`; this deployment
  uses `sparcd`), discovered by probing visible buckets for the marker. P0
  reuses that discovery for `species.json` rather than assuming the collection
  bucket.
- P0 validates the exact object path and JSON shape against the live bucket;
  the current marimo explorer proves CSV/media reads, not this species file.
  Watch for the same **id-is-not-unique** contract `locations.json` has (ids
  repeat with different data; upstream keys by a composite) — confirm whether
  species keys are unique before keying anything on them.
- Build a Fuse index over `commonName` + `scientificName` + `genus`.
- **Persistent, scrollable, browsable list — not only a type-to-filter
  popover.** Volunteers don't know the list cold; scanning to recognize a
  species is core workflow. Each row shows an **example thumbnail** of the
  animal + common name + scientific name + its assigned key (if any). Filter
  box at top; hierarchy (Genus → Species) drillable.
- **Per-species, user-assignable, persistent keybindings — not rotating
  numeric keys.** Each species can carry a stable key the user assigns once
  (shown as a kbd badge on its row, with an "assign key" affordance);
  pressing it tags that species; bindings are suppressed while the filter
  box is focused. This matches the SPARC'd Java app, where each species has
  a persisted `keyBinding` in `species.json` — so it is data-compatible.
  Rotating 1–9 "recent" keys are **not** used: they can't build muscle
  memory on a large list.
- "Recent / frequent this session" affects only **list ordering** (floats
  local fauna to the top), never key assignment.
- Example-image source is a build decision (per-species reference image or a
  representative already-tagged frame), sourced from the upstream SPARC'd
  species data / sparcd-web / Java app — not invented here.
- The vocabulary includes non-animal labels — notably **Ghost** (empty /
  false-trigger frame, shown as a text chip not a photo) — applied exactly
  like a species through the same list + bulk-tag path. Ghost is a core
  manual label, not a separate mechanism, and there is no automated ghost
  detection in this tool. Compatibility default: because Java keys detag/retag
  on whether `getSpeciesPresent().isEmpty()`, Ghost/Casper counts as
  species-present when encoded as a species/label row. That means Ghost-tagged
  images count toward `UploadMeta.json.imagesWithSpecies` and can be
  "retagged" from Java's perspective. Confirm before P0 whether this semantic
  should remain; changing it would intentionally diverge from Java behavior.

## Keyboard shortcuts (initial set)

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `J` / `K` | Next / previous image |
| `Shift+J` / `Shift+K` | Next / previous burst |
| `Space` | Open species autocomplete |
| `Enter` | Confirm selection |
| _assigned key_ | Apply the species/label bound to that key (user-assignable, persistent per species; suppressed while the filter box is focused) |
| `G` | Default binding for **Ghost** (empty / false-trigger frame) — a normal pre-bound label, common enough to ship bound |
| `X` | Mark as "questionable" |
| `Cmd/Ctrl+A` | Select current burst |
| `Cmd/Ctrl+S` | Save draft (auto-saves anyway; manual confirm) |
| `?` | Toggle cheatsheet modal |

## Phased delivery

| Phase | Scope | S3 writes |
|---|---|---|
| **P0** | **Shared Vitest contract harness first**: root/package `test` scripts, Java-baseline and `sparcd-web` fixture data, uploader-empty fixture, tagger-edited golden fixture; extend `@sparcd/camtrap` with v016 readers/merge helpers; prove uploader output parses and tagger merge output matches golden files; scaffold app, reuse the four shipped packages (`s3-safe`, `camtrap`, `types`, `auth-ui`); shared Connection screen; shipped uploader collection discovery (`sparcd-<uuid>` candidates); image viewer reads from a discovered collection; verify browser CORS for list/get/head; validate `Settings/species.json` path/shape | None |
| **P1** | Single-image tag editing; Dexie drafts; J/K nav; species autocomplete | None |
| **P2** | Sequence/burst grouping; full keyboard set; cheatsheet modal | None |
| **P3** | Batch tagging (multi-select); recovery view (local-only at this stage) | None |
| **P4** | Compatibility sync: immutable pre-write snapshots plus conditional canonical replacement of `<uploadPrefix>/media.csv`, `<uploadPrefix>/observations.csv`, and `<uploadPrefix>/UploadMeta.json`; only after manual review of `replaceIfUnchanged`, mocked wrapper tests, fixture-backed merge tests, and endpoint-specific CORS/PUT preflight | First writes, dry-run by default |
| **P5** | Snapshot/version recovery: load prior snapshots into local, restore through the same conditional canonical replacement flow | Same as P4 only on restore |
| **P6** | Internal navigation sections beyond the tagging core: Browse, History (surfaces the P5 recovery capability), Settings | Reads only |

P0–P3 are fully usable as a local-only tagger. The S3 write path doesn't
exist in the build until P4, which means the safety wrapper can be
reviewed in isolation before any real bucket is at risk.

## Open questions for before P0

1. **User identity for snapshots and edit comments.** The IAM access key
   stamps the bucket-side writer; we also need a logical `userId` for audit
   snapshot paths and mandatory `UploadMeta.json.editComments` entries.
   Options: prompt at session start, derive from access key, or pin to a
   config file. Lean: prompt + persist.
2. **First write-allowed bucket/credentials.** Not a build-time allowlist
   (that idea is gone — see Static BYO-S3 security contract); a concrete
   credential set whose IAM policy permits conditional `PUT` on canonical
   `media.csv` / `observations.csv` / `UploadMeta.json` and immutable snapshot
   writes on a real bucket, so P4 has somewhere to test compatibility writes.
3. ~~**Species hierarchy edits.**~~ Resolved: tagger never edits the
   hierarchy; missing species fall through to the `requestedSpecies`
   field (see Persistence — local), exported as a `[REQUESTED_SPECIES:…]`
   marker in the col-19 `comments` field for an upstream admin to act on.
   Cross-referenced in the Dexie schema.
4. ~~**Canonical merge path.**~~ Resolved by compatibility requirement: the
   tagger itself merges local edits into canonical `media.csv` and
   `observations.csv`, then updates canonical
   `UploadMeta.json.imagesWithSpecies` with Java-compatible delta semantics
   during P4 sync. Append-only files are audit snapshots only.
5. **Conditional replacement backend support.** Verify the target MinIO/R2/S3
   endpoints enforce `IfMatch` on `PutObject` from browser SDK calls and expose
   enough `HEAD` metadata/ETag via CORS. If a backend cannot enforce this, P4
   cannot safely write canonical metadata from a static app.
6. **Ghost/Casper counting semantics.** Compatibility default is that
   Ghost/Casper counts as species-present because Java treats any non-empty
   `speciesPresent` as tagged. Confirm before P0 that this is the intended
   user-facing meaning; otherwise the plan must document the intentional Java
   divergence and fixture expectations.

## Out of scope (explicit, for future tools)

- Image upload (tagger reads only; new images come from SPARC'd's upload
  flow)
- User management / permissions admin
- Species hierarchy admin
- Bulk export to formats other than Camtrap-DP CSV
- Map / spatial reports (that's the marimo explorer's job)

### Future ideas (post-MVP, noted so they aren't lost)

- **Automated ghost _prediction_ as an add-on.** Manual Ghost tagging is a
  core MVP label (see Species / label autocomplete) — this future item is
  only the *automated* part. A separate offline pass (e.g. the existing TF
  "Ghost" detector) would write a per-image predictions sidecar; the tagger
  could *optionally* consume it as advisory hints — pre-select likely-empty
  frames for the human to confirm with `G`, never auto-tag or auto-discard.
  We don't have a pre-classifier today. Keep an optional per-image
  prediction slot in the data model, but the tagger works fully without it.
- **Guided tour / first-run walkthrough.** A short interactive tour of the
  overview → focus → tag → sync flow for new users. Out of scope for MVP.
